Scribbles
=========

Scribbles simulates the motion of a pen connected to two arms connected
to two oscillators, oscillating according to a random waveform.

The problem was first solved and plotted using Mathematica.
It was then written in Gnuplot for plotting.
It was then written in PHP for use on a website.
The core numerical section was then pulled out into C and wrapped
in a PHP script.
For fun, it was also written in JavaScript.

This was written when I was only learning to code, so it has been
translated into several different languages here.
